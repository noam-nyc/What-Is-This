Title: I built an app for my grandma to identify things using AI - looking for beta testers

explains it in simple language.

Looking for beta testers who:
- Are 60+ OR help elderly family members with tech
- Speak English, Spanish, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Portuguese, 
  Russian, Hebrew, Japanese, or Korean

Features:
✓ Take photo or upload image
✓ AI explains in plain language
✓ Works in 11 languages
✓ Safety warnings for hazards

Beta testers get 50 FREE analyses (normally $13/month).
